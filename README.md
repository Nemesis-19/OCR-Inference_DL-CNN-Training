# OCR-Inference_DL-CNN-Training
Analyzing & Inferencing on OCR techniques (MM, Paddle & Easy OCR)
on FUNS Dataset, Created CNNs and trained on VOC & SVHN Dataset
(Image Classification, Segmentation & Detection using DL Techniques)

Major tasks in Key information extraction:
   Using OCR to identify the text and its position in the image
   Map the hand written text to its respective key/attribute (Name , Age, Address) in the image
   
Trainied CNN built from Scratch
Fine Tuned Resnet-18 & fc_resnet-50 models
Used different Deep Learning Techniques

Folders Contain Jupyter Notebooks along with designated datasets
